# waynergy

An implementation of a synergy client for wayland compositors. Based on the 
upstream uSynergy library (heavily modified for more protocol support and
a bit of paranoia).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* wayland, including wayland-scanner and the base protocols
* libxkbcommon
* libtls (either from libressl, or libretls)
* A compositor making use of [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots), or
(on an experimental basis) KDE, or (if all else fails) the willingness to run
questionable networking utilities with the privileges to access /dev/uinput
* [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) for clipboard support (*may not work on all compositors*)

### Building

```
meson build
cd build
ninja
ninja install
```

Note that KDE users may need to adjust the absolute path in `waynergy.desktop`
to satisfy kwin's trust checks; a mismatch will prevent the server from 
offering the required interface. 


### Running

#### Permissions/Security

Granting networking software written in questionable C the ability to 
generate arbitrary inputs isn't exactly a recipe for success if people are 
out to get you. Using TLS is essential in any case. 

##### wlroots (sway et al.)

There are no restrictions on privileged protocols at the moment (though that
[may eventually change](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/issues/3339)).
As such it should Just Workâ„¢. 

##### KDE

`waynergy.desktop` must be installed, and the path must be absolute or the
required interface will not be offered. 

##### uinput (everyone else)

First and foremost it should be kept in mind that kernel-level virtual input
may have undesirable side effects because the compositor is being completely
bypassed. This most notably means that virtual consoles are no longer isolated
as far as input is concerned, so simple lock screens can be easily bypassed if
more than one session is active. I've not tested the usability of magic 
SysRq, but that could also potentially be a great annoyance. With that out
of the way....

waynergy must be able to open `/dev/uinput` for this to work. Doing this for
the general case as part of the installation would require setuid, which I'm
not inclined to go with given obvious security implications (though it *will*
still work, i.e. drop privileges as expected). The alternative approach is to 
create an additional group specifically for uinput access, greatly reducing the 
risk involved, but possibly varying between systems.

In my case, a 'uinput' group is created, and a udev rule is used to modify the 
permissions appropriately:
```
# /etc/udev/rules.d/49-input.rules, in my case
KERNEL=="uinput",GROUP:="uinput",MODE:="0660"
```
From here, one *could* assign one's users to this group, but doing so would
open up uinput to every program, with all the potential issues noted in the 
first paragraph. The safest approach is probably setgid: 
```
# as root -- adjust path as needed
chown :uinput waynergy`
chmod g+s waynergy
```

#### CLI

See 
```
waynergy -h
```
output:
```

```

Also note that `SIGUSR1` triggers re-execution. Useful until proper recconect
procedures exist. 
### Configuration
The configuration files are stored in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/waynergy`, which is
probably at `~/.config/waynergy` in most cases. Aside from keymaps and hashes,
most things should go in `config.ini`; the old approach of
single-value-per-file is retained strictly for compatibility, and because 
ripping it out would be annoying for cases where that approach is really
genuinely useful (i.e. xkb keymaps which have their file format). The basic 
global values are `port`, `host`, `name`, `width`, and `height`, which do exactly
what the command line option would do. Options within sections are referred to
in the form `section/property` for the purposes of this document. 

In addition to `config.ini`, there is now support for snippets (with `.ini`
extension) under `config.ini.d/`. Any duplicate options will overwrite any
read previously. 

#### Keymap

There's also an xkb format keymap to provide, if the default is not sufficient;
it should be placed in `xkb_keymap`. The easiest way to obtain this if the
default is insufficient is to use the output of
```
setxkbmap -print
```
For custom keycodes, one may run into issues with Xwayland if the minimum
keycode is below 8. To work around this, an offset may be provided in 
the configuration as `xkb_key_offset`. 

##### Windows primary

Unfortunately there is no existing `xkb_keycodes` section included in
xkbcommon that will work with a Windows primary. To deal with this I've
included one that mostly works (minus the keys I don't actually have to test
on my own systems) in `doc/xkb/keycodes/win`. 

##### macOS primary

The same issue of keycodes applies here; see `doc/xkb/keycodes/mac` for
a usable configuration.

##### KDE/uinput

Because the fake input protocol used by KDE doesn't support custom keymaps, 
while uinput doesn't involve xkb at all, using xkb for this doesn't work; 
instead, one must use the `raw-keymap` section to map the remote keycodes to 
the local keymap using the form `remote = local`; for example, to use an 
OpenBSD server I must specify the following section to get arrow keys working 
properly:
```
[raw-keymap]
98 = 111
100 = 113
104 = 116
102 = 114
```
#### Screensaver

`screensaver/start` should contain a command to be run when the screensaver is
activated remotely, `screensaver/stop` should contain a command to terminate
it when it is deactivated. 

#### Idle inhibition hack

Due to issues with the idle inhibition protocol, idle is actually inhibited by
sending a hopefully-meaningless event to the compositor: if `idle-inhibit/method`
is `key`, the key associated with the xkb-style name in `idle-inhibit/keyname` is
pressed (defaults to `HYPR`). If `idle-inhbibit/method` is `mouse`, then a relative 
move of 0,0 is sent (this is the default). 

The mouse approach prevents any clashes with keys, but will prevent cursor
hiding.

#### TLS

Enabled or disabled with `tls/enable`. Certificate hashes (for any given host) 
are stored in the directory `tls/hash/`, one hash per file named after the
host. These can be obtained by running something like 
```
printf "SHA256:%s\n" $(openssl x509 -outform der -in $certpath | openssl dgst -sha256 | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
```
on the host. Comman values of $certpath would be
- `%LocalAppData%\Barrier\SSL\Barrier.pem`
- `~/.local/share/barrier/SSL/Barrier.pem`
- `$XDG_DATA_HOME/barrier/SSL/Barrier.pem`
- `~/.synergy/SSL/Synergy.pem`

There is also the option to trust on first use by setting `tls/tofu` or 
running with the `--enable-tofu` option on the command line, which will allow
verification that it has not changed on subsequent connections. 

Client certificates are now supported as well; simply place the certificate at
`tls/cert`.

* [uSynergy](https://github.com/symless/synergy-micro-client) for the protocol library
* The swaywm people, who've provided the protocols to make something like this
possible
* wl-clipboard, because its watch mode turns it into a clipboard manager so I
I don't have to.
* [mattiasgustavsson](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/libs) for the INI 
implementation.
* kwin developers for supporting a fake input protocol these days 

## TODO

At this point I'm content with most things here save for the following

* KDE likes to hide the mouse pointer if there is no pointing device 
currently installed. I don't think it's too much work to plug in a mouse,
but some would probably prefer a better workaround.
